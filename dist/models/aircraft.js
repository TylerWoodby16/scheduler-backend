// _id (which is an ObjectId) will be generated by Mongo
// automatically when we INSERT into database.
// however, we WILL add the userId to the object that we want to insert.

// {name: "whatever", year: 1992, userId: 1234534654643646 (whatever - it is an ObjectId)}
// finally, we will insert that object into mongo
